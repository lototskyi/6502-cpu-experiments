# 6502 CPU Experiments

This project is a hands-on exploration of the **6502 microprocessor** and its CMOS successor, the **W65C02**.  
I am learning computer architecture by building a homemade computer and running small test programs to see how the CPU interacts with memory, I/O, and peripherals.  

## Inspiration & References
- I follow [Ben Eaterâ€™s 6502 lessons](https://eater.net/6502) as step-by-step examples to understand the basics of the 6502 system.  
- My build is based on a **homemade W65C02 computer** design inspired by [mike42/6502-computer](https://github.com/mike42/6502-computer).  

## Goals
- Experiment with **clock generation, reset behavior, and bus timing**.  
- Explore **memory mapping and address decoding**.  
- Write and run **simple 6502 assembly programs**.  
- Gain practical understanding of how a CPU communicates with RAM, ROM, and peripherals.
